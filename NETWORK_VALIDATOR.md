### B. COVENANTS OF {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}}.

Subject to the conditions set forth in Section D, {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} will provide the {{DELEGATOR}} with the following Services:

(i) Delegation. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the {{DELEGATOR}} may, from time to time, delegate the Staking Rights or Voting Rights with respect to a specified number of Supported Digital Assets to {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} via the delegation mechanism established by the applicable Supported Network Protocol. Staking Rights that have been Delegated to {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} by or on behalf of {{DELEGATOR}} in accordance with this Agreement are referred to as “Delegated Staking Rights” and Voting Rights that have been Delegated to {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} by or on behalf of {{DELEGATOR}} in accordance with this Agreement are referred to as “Delegated Voting Rights”. IF THE {{DELEGATOR}} DOES NOT AGREE TO (OR CANNOT COMPLY WITH) ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, {{DELEGATOR}} SHALL NOT DELEGATE TO {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}}.

(ii) Staking. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform Staking with respect to any Delegated Staking Rights in a manner intended to cause {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} to Receive Rewards in accordance with the applicable Supported Network Protocol. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} may perform such Staking in any commercially reasonable manner, including by consolidating such Delegated Staking Rights with other {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}}-controlled Staking Rights.

(iii) Voting Rights. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} may (but shall not be required to) exercise any Delegated Voting Rights in its sole and absolute discretion. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} assumes no responsibility for any third-party action taken against the {{DELEGATOR}} in connection with those actions. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} will not be liable as a result of any violation in Applicable Law, mistake of judgment, or any other matter or thing done, suffered, or omitted to be done under this Agreement, except for any claims relating to the {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}}' fraud or willful misconduct.

### C. REWARDS, WITHDRAWALS, REVOCATION FORKS, AND FORFEITURES.

(i) Calculation of Rewards.

(a) Rewards for each Supported Network Protocol will be calculated based on a percentage which shall be set out as a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of the particular type of the Supported Digital Asset with respect to which {{DELEGATOR}} has Delegated Staking Rights (“{{DELEGATOR}} Delegated Digital Assets”) and, (ii) the denominator of which is the number of that type of Supported Digital Asset with respect to which all {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} {{DELEGATOR}}s have Delegated Staking Rights (“Total Delegated Digital Assets”).

(b) {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} shall have the sole right to determine the exact timing that the record of both the {{DELEGATOR}} Delegated Digital Assets and the Total Delegated Digital Assets (a “Snapshot”) are documented. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} will determine the calculation set forth in Sections (C)(i)(a) and (b) based on a given Snapshot of the applicable Supported Network Protocol.

(c) Additionally, in the majority of Supported Network Protocols, the Snapshot, Reward calculations and distributions are all hardcoded into the Blockchain. For such Supported Network Protocols, Rewards are immutable and {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} has no control over the calculations or payouts.

(d) Once (i) Rewards are Received, the amount of such Rewards minus the {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} Service Fee shall be allocated to {{DELEGATOR}} (“{{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards”).

(ii) Service Payments. Once the {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards are earned, {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} shall deduct (or the Supported Network Protoocl will automatically deduct) for {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}}’ own account a service fee as set forth on the {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} Website from the Rewards for providing the Services (“{{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} Service Fee”).

(iii) No Guarantee of Rewards. {{DELEGATOR}} acknowledges that Rewards are not guaranteed and that {{DELEGATOR}} may not receive any Reward related to their Delegated Staking and Voting Rights.

(iv) Taxes. {{DELEGATOR}} shall be responsible for payment of all applicable taxes, if any, to which the {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards might be subject and any and all other taxes which may apply to {{DELEGATOR}} or the {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards; {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} makes no representations in this regard. {{DELEGATOR}} agrees to indemnify and hold {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} Indemnified Persons harmless against any taxes, including penalties, duties and interest levied by any government on the {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards. Additionally, {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} may withhold taxes on behalf of the {{DELEGATOR}} if requested by a governmental agency. The characterization of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for U.S. federal income tax purposes is unclear, and accordingly the U.S. federal income tax consequences of Delegating Digital Assets and the sharing of Rewards is uncertain. Neither {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} nor any of its agents shall provide any advice or guidance with respect to the tax obligations of the {{DELEGATOR}}. {{DELEGATOR}} is strongly encouraged to seek advice from your own tax advisor to discuss the potential tax consequences of entering into this Agreement and the receipt of any {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards.

(v) Delegation of Rights Associated with Rewards. Upon Receipt of {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards, {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} will cause the Staking Rights or Voting Rights for such {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards to be Delegated to {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}}, and, from and after such Delegation, such Staking Rights will be deemed Delegated Staking Rights, and such Voting Rights will be deemed Delegated Voting Rights, for all purposes of this Agreement, including Sections (B)(ii) and (B)(iii).

(vi) Withdrawal of Rewards.

(a) Subject to the {{DELEGATOR}} covenants specified in Section D, {{DELEGATOR}} shall have the right to Withdrawal of {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards.

(b) Except as set forth above or with respect to any Voting Rights or Staking Rights that may remain Delegated to {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} hereunder, {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} shall not have any responsibility with respect to any Rewards. Additionally, if any Rewards are lost, destroyed, or transferred to an incorrect wallet address {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} shall bear no responsibility or liability unless such loss was a result of intentional misconduct or fraud on the part of {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}}.

(c) {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} may make Withdrawals of any {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} Service Fees at its sole discretion, subject to any restrictions imposed by the applicable Network Protocol.

(d) The {{DELEGATOR}} acknowledges and agrees that Delegated Staking Rights, Delegated Voting Rights or {{DELEGATOR}} Earned Rewards may not be accessible during Unbonding Periods or as a result of other restrictions imposed by the applicable Network Protocol and may be lost due to Forfeitures imposed by the applicable Network Protocol. THE {{DELEGATOR}} ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS MAY LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES OR FORGONE OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} HAS NO CONTROL OVER SUCH RESTRICTIONS.

(vii) Revocation of Delegation. The {{DELEGATOR}} may start the process of revoking its Delegation with respect to any or all of its Delegated Staking Rights and Delegated Voting Rights at any time by interacting directly with the Network Protocol. {{DELEGATOR}} ACKNOWLEDGES THAT {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE REVOCATION OF A DELEGATION HOWEVER REVOCATION MAY BE AFFECTED BY UNBONDING PERIODS.

(viii) Operating Changes, Forks and Airdrops. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}}’ response to any material operating change of a Network Protocol, hard fork or airdrop is subject to {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} sole discretion and includes deciding not to support any new Digital Asset, hard fork, airdrop or other actions. {{DELEGATOR}} accepts the risks of operating changes or hard forks to Network Protocols and agrees that {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} is not responsible for such operating changes, hard forks or airdrops and is not liable for any loss of value {{DELEGATOR}} may experience as a result of such changes in operating rules, hard forks or airdrops. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} has sole discretion to determine its response to any operating changes, hard forks or airdrops and {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} has no responsibility to assist {{DELEGATOR}} with unsupported Network Protocols, Digital Assets or airdrops.

(ix) Forfeitures. {{DELEGATOR}} SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL LOSSES RELATED TO FORFEITURES OF THEIR DELEGATED DIGITAL ASSETS. {{NETWORK_OPERATOR}} SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY FORFEITURES OF {{DELEGATOR}}’S DELEGATED DIGITAL ASSETS OR {{DELEGATOR}} EARNED REWARDS.

### G. MISCELLANEOUS.

(i) Dispute Resolution

This Agreement is governed by, and shall be construed and enforced under, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed wholly within such State, without regard to any choice or conflict of laws rules. If a dispute arises out of or relates to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, and if said dispute cannot be settled through negotiation it shall be finally resolved by arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Disputes will not be resolved in any other forum or venue. The arbitrator shall monitor and reasonably limit discovery in the arbitration to ensure the efficient and timely adjudication of the Parties’ dispute, and to prevent the harassment or burden of the Parties’ respective employees, agents, business partners or third parties. Document discovery shall be limited to information requests deemed necessary and potentially admissible by the arbitrator for adjudication of the dispute. Neither party shall communicate with or seek to subpoena any third-party witness absent prior leave from the arbitrator and upon a showing of necessity related to the claims or defenses in suit. The arbitrator may order that a requesting party pay for discovery related fees or costs reasonably and actually incurred by the other side. The arbitration award will not include factual findings or conclusions of law, and no punitive damages will be awarded. Judgment may be entered upon any award granted in any arbitration in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county and state in which the prevailing party maintains its principal office at the time the award is rendered, or in any other court having jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate shall apply to both Parties. The Parties understand that they are giving up their right to a trial in a court of law.

(ii) Class Action Waiver

The Parties agree that any arbitration or other permitted action with respect to any dispute shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SUCH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN SUCH PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator makes a final, binding and non-appealable determination that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void with respect to any dispute that would thus be required to be resolved by arbitration on a class basis, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate such dispute. In the event that, as a result of the application of the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise, any dispute is not subject to arbitration, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California and to accept service of process by mail with respect to such dispute, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available with respect to such dispute.
